Metalsmith-excerptor
====================

A Metalsmith plugin to create an excerpt from html data, it truncates correctly
all html tags thanks to [html-truncate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-truncate).

Usage
-----

```javascript
var excerptor = require('metalsmith-excerptor');

Metalsmith(__dirname)
    .use( excerptor({
        maxLength: 800,
        keepImageTag: true,
        ellipsis: 'â€¦'
    }))

```

`excerptor` will create a new attribute to all object files with a max length of
800 characters, keeping the image tags (`<img>`).

Options
-------

**maxLength** `Number` (optional, default=`300`): Excerpt's max length

**keepImageTag** `Boolean` (optional, default=`true`)

**ellipsis** `String` (optional, default=`''`): String attached to the end of the excerpt
